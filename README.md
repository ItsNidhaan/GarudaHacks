#### *Intro*

Teach for tomorrow is a platform for people who are willing and passionate about teaching students for better tomorrow. It helps in organizing the community of such people who want to give some time for the betterment of lives of those who are unfortunate. This project aims at providing quality education to those who are unable to go to schools due to financial reasons.

Here one can request a requirement which ranges from anything from a volunteer to a proper instructor to any item as per the problem regarding the education of the masses and whoever finds himself capable of fulfilling the requirement can contact him/her and can assure the proper transfer for resources.
